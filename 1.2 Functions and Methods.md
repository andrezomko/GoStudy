## Golang 1.2 Functions and Methods

 **Functions** in Go are first-class citizens that can be defined, passed as arguments, and returned by other functions.
- **Methods** are functions with a receiver argument. The receiver is a struct (or any user-defined type) that the method acts upon.

## Everyday Must-Know Use Cases
1. **Basic Function**
   - Use functions to organize reusable blocks of code, handling specific tasks, and separating logic.

2. **Method on Struct**
   - Methods allow you to associate functions with structs to encapsulate behavior specific to that type.

##  Pitfalls

- **Value vs. Pointer Receiver**: When using methods, be mindful of whether you use a value receiver or a pointer receiver.
    - **Value receiver**: The method operates on a copy of the struct.
    - **Pointer receiver**: The method can modify the original struct.
- **Overuse of Methods**: If not necessary, using too many methods instead of simple functions can clutter your structs with unrelated logic.

## Best Practices

- Use **methods** when the function logically belongs to the struct (e.g., operations like `Area` for a shape struct).
- Use **pointer receivers** when the method modifies the struct or when you need to avoid copying large structs.
- Keep functions **small** and **focused** on doing one thing to ensure reusability and testability.
- Prefer **passing functions** as arguments where it enhances modularity and reuse.
