- A **Goroutine** is a lightweight thread managed by the Go runtime.
- It allows you to execute functions or methods concurrently without managing threads explicitly.
- Goroutines are created using the `go` keyword followed by a function call.
- They are cheaper than threads and can grow dynamically as needed.

- **Syntax**: `go functionName(args...)`

- **Concurrency vs Parallelism**: Goroutines provide concurrency, but actual parallelism depends on the system and the Go runtime.


### Example 1: Easy Use Case

Spawning a basic goroutine to run a function concurrently.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func sayHello() {
    fmt.Println("Hello from goroutine!")
}

func main() {
    go sayHello() // Spawns a new goroutine
    time.Sleep(1 * time.Second) // Wait to ensure goroutine executes
    fmt.Println("Main function execution")
}


```

## Pitfalls

1. **Premature Exit**: If the main function finishes before the goroutines, the program exits without completing goroutine tasks.
    
    - **Solution**: Use synchronization techniques like `WaitGroup` or `Channels` to ensure goroutines finish.
2. **Race Conditions**: Multiple goroutines accessing shared data can lead to race conditions.
    
    - **Solution**: Use synchronization primitives like **mutexes** or **channels** to safely access shared data.
3. **Unbounded Goroutines**: Creating too many goroutines without control can exhaust system resources.
    
    - **Solution**: Use goroutine pools to limit the number of active goroutines.


## Best Practices

1. **Use WaitGroup or Channels**: Always synchronize goroutines using `sync.WaitGroup` or `channels` to prevent premature termination or race conditions.
    
2. **Handle Errors**: Ensure that goroutines properly handle errors or recover from panics to prevent unexpected crashes.
    
3. **Limit Number of Goroutines**: Use worker pools or bounded semaphores when working with a large number of goroutines to avoid resource exhaustion.
    
4. **Avoid Long-Running Goroutines**: Design goroutines to complete tasks quickly. For long-running tasks, consider using background services or jobs.
    
5. **Defer Cleanup**: Always use `defer wg.Done()` in a goroutine to ensure the `WaitGroup` counter is decremented even in case of a panic.
