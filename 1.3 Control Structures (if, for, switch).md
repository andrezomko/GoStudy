### Everyday Must-Know Use Cases 

1. **If-Else Statements**
   - Conditionally execute blocks of code based on Boolean expressions.

2. **For Loops**
   - Iterate over ranges, arrays, or just execute a block of code repeatedly with loop conditions.

3. **Switch Statements**
   - Efficient for handling multiple conditions and selecting different actions.


## Pitfalls

- **Omitting the `else`**: Unlike other languages, Go doesn't require an `else` clause. However, be cautious of logic that unintentionally skips an `else` path.
    
- **Infinite Loops with `for`**: Be careful with `for` loops that don't have proper termination conditions.
    

    
```go
    for { // This runs forever   
      fmt.Println("Infinite loop") }
```
    
- **Switch without `fallthrough`**: Go’s `switch` doesn’t fall through by default like in other languages. If needed, use the `fallthrough` keyword explicitly.
## Best Practices

- Use **`if`** when you need to check simple Boolean conditions.
- Use **`for`** for all loop iterations. Avoid other types of loops like `while` (since `for` can handle all looping use cases).
- Prefer **`switch`** over complex `if-else` chains for readability and simplicity.
- Use **`break`** or **`continue`** in `for` loops when necessary to exit or skip iterations
- **Avoid over-complicating** switch cases. If your switch has too many branches, consider refactoring.

### obs: 
####  **break**: exits the loop entirely. No further iterations. Even if there are remaining iterations left.


####  **continue** :  skips only the current iteration. Proceeds to next iteration.
