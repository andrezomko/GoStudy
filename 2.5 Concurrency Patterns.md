## 1. Worker Pool Pattern (With Error Handling)
- **Purpose**: Distribute tasks among a fixed number of workers.
- **Use Case**: Limit the number of goroutines running at once, handle tasks concurrently, and capture errors.

**Key Points**:
- Pass errors through an error channel.
- Ensure the main goroutine handles and logs errors.

**Quick Example**:
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

func worker(id int, jobs <-chan int, results chan<- int, errChan chan<- error, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
	defer wg.Done()
	for job := range jobs {
		if job == 0 { // Example error condition
			errChan <- fmt.Errorf("worker %d: invalid job %d", id, job)
			continue
		}
		results <- job * 2 // Example result
	}
}

func main() {
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	jobs := make(chan int, 5)
	results := make(chan int, 5)
	errChan := make(chan error, 5)

	// Start 3 workers
	for w := 1; w <= 3; w++ {
		wg.Add(1)
		go worker(w, jobs, results, errChan, &wg)
	}

	// Send jobs
	for j := 1; j <= 5; j++ {
		jobs <- j
	}
	close(jobs)

	// Wait for workers to finish
	go func() {
		wg.Wait()
		close(results)
		close(errChan)
	}()

	// Handle results and errors
	for res := range results {
		fmt.Println("Result:", res)
	}

	for err := range errChan {
		fmt.Println("Error:", err)
	}
}
```


## 2. Pipeline Pattern (With Error Handling)

- **Purpose**: Process data through multiple stages in a pipeline.
- **Use Case**: Sequentially process data while capturing errors at any stage.

**Key Points**:
- Each stage can pass errors through a dedicated error channel.

**Quick Example**:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

// Generate integers 
func generate(errChan chan<- error, nums ...int) <-chan int {
	out := make(chan int)
	go func() {
		for _, n := range nums {
			if n == 0 {
				errChan <- fmt.Errorf("generate: invalid input %d", n)
				continue
			}
			out <- n
		}
		close(out)
	}()
	return out
}

// Square integers 
func square(in <-chan int, errChan chan<- error) <-chan int {
	out := make(chan int)
	go func() {
		for n := range in {
			if n < 0 {
				errChan <- fmt.Errorf("square: cannot square negative number %d", n)
				continue
			}
			out <- n * n
		}
		close(out)
	}()
	return out
}

func main() {
	errChan := make(chan error)
	nums := generate(errChan, 2, -3, 0, 4)
	results := square(nums, errChan)

	// Handle results and errors
	for res := range results {
		fmt.Println("Square result:", res)
	}

	for err := range errChan {
		fmt.Println("Error:", err)
	}
}
```

- **Channels**:  pass data **between the stages**. Each stage reads from an **input channel** and writes to an **output channel.**
- **Concurrency**: each stage runs its own goroutine.
- **Close channels** after the data is processed to signal the downstream stages that no more data is coming. Can result in **deadlocks**.
#### - **Sequential, but Concurrent**: 
- Each stage of the pipeline processes data sequentially (as it receives it).
- Between the stages, we have **concurrency**. As each stage has his own goroutine.
	- *different stages working on different pieces of data at the same time.*

		==SEQUENCIAL WITHIN A STAGE X CONCURRENT ACROSS STAGES==



- Fan-in**: Combine multiple channel inputs into one.
- **Fan-out**: Distribute tasks from one input to multiple workers.
- **Select Multiplexing**: Handle multiple channel operations with select.
- **Cancellation with Context**: Gracefully cancel long-running operations.
- **Goroutine Leak Prevention**: Ensure goroutines terminate



## Fan-In Pattern

- multiple goroutines (or channels)  producing data
- their outputs are **merged** into a single chan
- multiple concurrent tasks feeding data into a common output stream (with a single consumer)

-  ==multiple inputs -> single output==

collect results from multiple sources (goroutines or channels) and combine them into one single output channel for further processing.

```Go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

// Producer 1: generates a message after a delay
func producer1(ch chan<- string) {
	time.Sleep(2 * time.Second) // Simulate delay
	ch <- "Message from producer 1"
}

// Producer 2: same as prod 1
func producer2(ch chan<- string) {
	time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
	ch <- "Message from producer 2"
}

// Fan-In func: merges two channels into one
func fanIn(ch1, ch2 <-chan string) <-chan string {
	out := make(chan string)
	go func() {
		for {
			select {
			case msg := <-ch1:
				out <- msg
			case msg := <-ch2:
				out <- msg
			}
		}
	}()
	return out
}

func main() {
	// create two channels for the producers
	ch1 := make(chan string)
	ch2 := make(chan string)

	// start the producers
	go producer1(ch1)
	go producer2(ch2)

	// Merge the channels - fanIn
	mergedChannel := fanIn(ch1, ch2)

	// Read from the merged channel
	for i := 0; i < 2; i++ { //2 messages, one from each producer
		fmt.Println(<-mergedChannel)
	}
}

```

## Fan-Out Pattern

- single source of data is distributed to multiple workers.
